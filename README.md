# Bitcoin Intersect
A research demonstration of BitCoin key intersect probability, that runs random keys against known large wallets.

## Premise 
The time to run all keys equates to multimple lifetimes of computation with the fastest PC's running optimised versions of the same concept. The odds are so staggering that it becomes impossible. Yet, people win the lottery even with similar, terrible odds. 

This app effectively plays the BitCoin lottery on your behalf. If it "wins", you end up with the keys to one of the largest BitCoin wallets on earth. 

## Disclaimer
How, and even if you should use this code - it's use is up to your own discression. It's intended purpose is for research purposes. Should you use it and unlock a wallet - you prove that even in an infinate scrambled series, the first random number tested just as well be the one you are looking for. The odds are ultimately the same. 

However, no liability is taken for this software, or for any damages caused by anyone using it.
